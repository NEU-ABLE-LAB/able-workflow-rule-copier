  The rule "{{ rule_name }}" has been created successfully.

  See `logs/post-copier-todos/rule-{{ rule_name }}.md` for next steps on
  implementing your rule into the project. You can copy-paste the contents
  of that file into a GitHub issue or a project management tool to track
  the implementation of the rule.
