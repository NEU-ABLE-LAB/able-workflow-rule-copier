# Post-Copy Checklist

After running `copier copy`, see `.copier-answers/post-copier-todos/rule-{{ rule_name }}.md` for next steps on implementing your rule into the project. You can copy-paste the contents of that file into a GitHub issue or a project management tool to track the implementation of the rule.
