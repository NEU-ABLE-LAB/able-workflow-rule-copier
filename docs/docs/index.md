A [copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) template for generating a snakemake workflow rule that may use the project's python package.

This template assumes that you have already created an [`able-workflow-copier`](https://github.com/NEU-ABLE-LAB/able-workflow-copier-dev) project and have optionally created a [`able-workflow-module-copier`](https://github.com/NEU-ABLE-LAB/able-workflow-module-copier-dev) module and [`able-workflow-etl-copier`](https://github.com/NEU-ABLE-LAB/able-workflow-etl-copier-dev) ETL process.
