# Contributing to ABLE Workflow Rule Copier

## Tests

The test environments are managed with `tox`.

### Validating template generation

This template is to be run in a project that was created with [`able-workflow-copier`]({{ able_workflow_copier_docs }}). To test the rendering of this template, that parent template needs to also be rendered. The version of the parent template that are used for tests is specified in `.github/workflows/pr.yml` and pulled in `scripts/pull_able_workflow_copier.py`.

!!! note "Updating `able-workflow-copier` version"

    Once `scripts/sandbox_examples_generate.py` or `tests/template/conftest.py` create the local copy of the `able-workflow-copier` repo in the `sandbox/` they do not check to see if it needs updating. To ensure that the local and cloud repos are in sync, regularly run `rm -rf sandbox/able-workflow-copier-dev`

Example Copier answers are provided in the `answers/` directory. The followign command runs the tests for these examples:

    ```bash
    tox run -e py312-template-generate
    ```
